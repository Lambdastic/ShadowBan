# ShadowBan

This is a replica of Reddit's Shadow Ban feature in Minecraft using the Spigot API. A shadow ban is a mute on someone where they have no idea they are muted. To them everything seems the same, but in reality, no one can see his or her messages. A spy feature is available for admins or mods who can see the shadow banned player's messages.

##Commands:
> /shadowban {player} [reason] - Shadow bans a player with an optional reason.
> /shadowban check {player} - Check the status of a players shadow ban.
> /shadowban spy {player} - View that shadow banned player's messages he or she sends.
> /shadowban help - View all these commands in game.

##Permissions:
> shadowban.shadowban - Required to shadow ban a player.
> shadowban.check - Required to check a player's shadow ban status.
> shadowban.spy - Required to spy on a player who is shadow banned.
> shadowban.help - Required to see all commands in game.
